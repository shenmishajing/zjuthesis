  abstract = {Background
National Cancer Center (NCC) updated nationwide cancer statistics using population-based cancer registry data in 2015.
Methods
501 cancer registries submitted data, among which 368 registries with high quality data were included in analysis. Numbers of nationwide new cancer cases and deaths were estimated using incidence and mortality rates and corresponding national population stratified by area, gender, age group and cancer site. The world Segi's population was applied for the calculation of age-standardized rates.
Results
About 3,929,000 new cancer cases were diagnosed. The crude incidence rate was 285.83/100,000 and the age-standardized incidence rate by world standard population (ASIRW) was 186.39/100,000. ASIRW was higher in urban areas than in rural areas. South China had the highest ASIRW while Southwest China had the lowest ASIRW. Age-specific incidence rate was higher in males for population younger than 20 years or over 49 years. From 2000 to 2015, the ASIRW for esophageal cancer, gastric cancer and liver cancer decreased significantly. The ASIRW for colorectal cancer in whole population and for lung cancer, breast cancer, cervix cancer, uterus cancer and thyroid cancer in females increased significantly. 2,338,000 cancer deaths were reported. The crude mortality rate was 170.05/100,000 and the age standardized mortality rate by world standard population (ASMRW) was 105.84/100,000. ASMRW was higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Central China had the highest ASMRW while North China had the lowest ASMRW. Age-specific mortality rates in males were higher than that in females in every age group. From 2000 to 2015, the ASMRW for esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer and lung cancer decreased significantly. The ASMRW for colorectal cancer, pancreas cancer and prostate cancer in males and for breast cancer, cervix cancer and thyroid cancer in females increased significantly.
Conclusions
Cancer has become a major life-threatening disease in China. Disease burdens differed across areas. Disease burdens for esophageal cancer, gastric cancer and liver cancer have decreased, while disease burdens for colorectal cancer, female breast cancer, cervix cancer and thyroid cancer have increased over the last 15 years. National and regional initiative for cancer prevention and control should be prioritized.}

  abstract = {Automated detection of cervical cancer cells/clumps has the potential to significantly reduce error rate and increase productivity in cervical cancer screening. However, most traditional methods rely on the success of accurate cell segmentation and discriminative hand-crafted features extraction. Recently there are emerging deep learning-based methods which train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify cell patches or to detect cells from the whole image. But the former is computationally expensive, while the latter often requires a large-scale dataset with expensive annotations. In this paper we propose an efficient cervical cancer cells/clumps detection method, called Comparison detector, to deal with the limited data problem. Specifically, we utilize the state-of-the-art proposal-based object detection method, Faster R-CNN with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) as the baseline and replace the classification of each proposal by comparing it with the prototype representation of each category. In addition, we propose to learn the prototype representation of the background category from data instead of manually choosing them by some heuristic rules. Experimental results show that the proposed Comparison detector yields significant improvement on the small dataset, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 26.3% and an Average Recall (AR) of 35.7%, both improved by about 20% comparing to the baseline. Moreover, when training on the medium-sized dataset, our Comparison detector gains a mAP of 48.8% and an AR of 64.0%, improving the AR by 5.1% and the mAP by 3.6% respectively. Our method is promising for the development of automation-assisted cervical cancer screening systems. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/kuku-sichuan/ComparisonDetector.}
